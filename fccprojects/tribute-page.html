      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p id="profile">was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists
        of
        all time. Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to
        the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two
        pillars
        of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been
        dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of
        science.
        He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his
        discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His
        intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius"</p>
      <h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1879</strong>
          Born to Hermann Einstein (a featherbed salesman) and his wife Pauline in Ulm, Germany.</li>
        <li><strong>1884</strong>
          Receives his first compass around this time, inspiring a lifelong quest to investigate mysteries of the
          natural
          world.</li>
        <li><strong>1889</strong>
          Settles into a program of self-education at age 10 and begins reading as much about science as he can.</li>
        <li><strong>1894</strong>
          Stays on in Munich to finish the school year after his parents move to Pavia, Italy. Lasts only one term on
          his
          own and then follows his family to Italy.</li>
        <li><strong>1895</strong>
          Attempts to skip high school by taking an entrance exam to the Swiss Polytechnic, a top technical university,
          but fails the arts portion. His family sends him to the Swiss town of Aarau to finish high school.</li>
        <li><strong>1896</strong>
          Graduates from high school at age 17 and enrolls at the ETH (the Federal Polytechnic School) in Zurich.</li>
        <li><strong>1898</strong>
          Falls in love with Mileva Maric, a Serbian classmate at the ETH.</li>
        <li><strong>1900</strong> Graduates from the ETH.</li>
        <li><strong>1901</strong>
          Becomes a Swiss citizen and, unemployed, searches for work. Meets Maric in northern Italy for a tryst, and she
          becomes pregnant. In the fall, he finds work in Schaffhausen, Switzerland as a tutor. Maric, visibly pregnant,
          moves to Stein am Rhein, three miles upriver. She then returns to her parents' home to give birth to her
          child.
          Einstein moves to Bern.</li>
        <li><strong>1902</strong>
          In January, Maric gives birth to their daughter, Lieserl, whom they eventually put up for adoption. Lieserl
          reportedly becomes ill, and then all record of her disappears. Einstein takes a job at the Swiss Patent
          Office.
          Hermann Einstein becomes ill and dies.</li>
        <li><strong>1903</strong>
          Marries Maric in January.</li>

        <li><strong>1905</strong>
          Publishes, at age 26, five groundbreaking papers, making this his "annus mirabilis," or miracle year. One of
          the
          papers introduces his special theory of relativity and another E = mc2.</li>
